**Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using Sklearn**

This project demonstrates how to perform topic modeling on a small corpus using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) implemented in scikit-learn. It includes end-to-end steps starting from text preprocessing to extracting interpretable topics from the documents.

**Key Features**

ðŸ“‚ Loading and combining multiple text documents as corpus.

ðŸ§¹ Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, punctuation cleaning, and lemmatization.

ðŸ“Š Feature extraction using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer.

ðŸ§  Topic extraction using LDA (LatentDirichletAllocation) from sklearn.decomposition.

ðŸ“Œ Visualizing topics and their top contributing words.

ðŸ§¾ Assigning the most probable topic to each document.

**Example Output**

Topics Identified:

Topic 1: ['movie', 'good', 'watch', 'book', 'weekend']

Topic 2: ['zealand', 'test', 'beating', 'world', 'championship']

Topic 3: ['weekend', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'book']
...

**Document-to-Topic Mapping**

Document 1 --> Topic 2

Document 2 --> Topic 1

...

**Technologies Used**

* Python

* Scikit-learn

* NLTK

* NumPy, Pandas

**Use Cases in Development & Live Environments**

**Development Environment**

âœ… Prototype NLP pipelines for document classification or clustering.

âœ… Quickly test topic discovery techniques on small sets of articles, customer reviews, chat transcripts, etc.

âœ… Evaluate and compare performance of TF-IDF vs CountVectorizer for different domains (e.g., e-commerce reviews vs. news headlines).

âœ… Validate text cleaning pipelines (tokenization, lemmatization, etc.) before applying to large datasets.

âœ… Integrate into Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Live (Production) Environment**

**ðŸ“‘ Content Categorization:** Automatically tag support tickets, feedback forms, or blog posts with relevant topics.

**ðŸ“° News Aggregation:** Group similar articles into topic clusters for personalized content feeds.

**ðŸ›’ E-commerce:** Detect dominant topics in customer reviews or Q&A to highlight key product features/issues.

**ðŸ¤– Chatbots & Virtual Assistants:** Use topic modeling as a fallback to classify ambiguous or unknown intents.

**ðŸ“Š Data Dashboarding:** Embed topic trends over time into dashboards for product teams or customer service analytics.
